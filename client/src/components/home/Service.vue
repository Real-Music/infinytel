                <h2>USING VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS</h2>

                <p>If you’re concerned about protecting your business from would-be intruders, you may wish to look into video surveillance systems. These systems can offer your home an added measure of protection.In addition to installing deadbolt locks and other security features, you may wish to install a surveillance system.There are many great systems available on the market today. From those that you can speak to from a remote area to those that you simply monitor, modern technology has made it easier than ever before to protect your home and business.</p>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Such surveillance systems are easy to install and can be
                  <strong>
                    <q>monitored</q>
                  </strong> either by you yourself or by a top
                  <strong>
                    <q>security company</q>
                  </strong> like
                  <strong>Infinytel.</strong> Either way, you’ve gained an extra measure of protection for your home.
                  If you’re the one that is monitoring your system you can have it ping you each time someone is at your door or breaches your motion detector.
                  Then, you can open an app and see who it is or if it’s an intruder. Once you know this information you can either communicate with them (if that is the type of system that you have) or you can call the police and have them check your premises.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Surveillance systems can reduce your homeowner’s insurance drastically. You’ll appreciate getting discounts on your insurance and being able to save money.
                  With modern technology what it is today, you can save a lot by installing video surveillance systems and it won’t be that expensive to do. Installation can be done in a few short hours or days depending on the type of installation.

                <p>
                  Access control systems restrict who may enter a facility in specified areas. Entry can be determined by person, day of the week, and/or time of day.
                  Building Security Systems (BSS) designs and installs quality, facility-specific work that secures property entry and complements existing infrastructure.
                  Upon request, BSS analysts can provide policy recommendations for lobby site visitor administration as well.

                  <strong>ADVANTAGES OF ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS OVER LOCK-AND-KEY SECURITY</strong>
                </h5>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Access command enables administrators to control when doors can be opened and by whom. With keys, access is all or nothing. If a worker has a key, he or she can enter any time of day or night</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>With card access, the system can disable a card when a card is lost or an individual no longer has entry privileges. If a key is lost or a staff member leaves, facility safety is compromised unless every lock is re-keyed</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Cards cannot be replicated. Keys can be duplicated, and there is no way to track who has a key</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Accessibility control systems develop an in-depth audit trail so administrators can understand precisely whose card opened up a doorway and when. Workers understand this, which discourages inappropriate behavior. Keys are anonymous.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>With accessibility command, one card opens every doorway the worker is enabled to open up. There’s no requirement for different keys for every lock (no more “large ring of keys”)</p>

                  <strong>ACCESS CONTROL SERVICES FOR ADDED SECURITY</strong>
                </h5>
                <p>Both employers and employees appreciate having a controlled door access system. This system is easy to use and involves either entering a code to get into your building or swiping a card. Even customers and clients will appreciate entering a building where there are access control systems installed. The peace of mind that access control services can bring is incredibly valuable. Additionally, today’s computerized systems are capable of protecting privacy.</p>
                <br />

                <p>There are more and more laws being issued all the time regarding businesses and their responsibility towards other people’s privacy. There are many components of these systems and each of them can be laid out and installed perfectly to work just the way your employees do. They will appreciate the extra layer of protection provided to them on a daily basis while on the job. In the event of a security breach, your system will alert authorities and get the situation under control.</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  While each building will have different needs, the main part of the system is the access control panel. This unit will get information from electrified door locks, keypads and card readers and permit entry only when it is authorized. You might also get a cloud-based component to make controlling and
                  <strong>monitoring</strong> the entire system as easy as it can be.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  You can also expect to have your
                  <strong>security service</strong> install card readers and provide your firm with employee cards for authorized entry. Systems can also be outfitted with sensors that allow exiting from the building when they detect a person standing beneath them. If you are ready to get an access control services in place you will want to work with a company that is a leader in this industry. They should have the proven experience to customize a whole system for you and install it.

                  <strong>INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS ARE IMPORTANT FOR NETWORK SECURITY</strong>
                </h5>

                <p>When it comes to system networks, there are all kinds of threats. That’s why many businesses and organizations take advantage of intrusion detection systems. They are very helpful in many different ways, but they can also be very complicated to understand. Do you have one of these systems in place? When you’re talking computers, you may be thinking about a firewall. However, an intrusion detection system isn’t what a firewall is about. Think about what the word intrusion means. It means that someone has broken in, right? A firewall means you have a wall up. So, you might need that firewall, too, but these intrusion detection systems are important for a variety of other reasons.</p>
                <br />

                <p>When you’re looking at these different systems, you do want to know the differences. Some are much more involved than others, and there are also different types. Now, firewalls were mentioned, and we said they were different from these systems we’re talking about. However, there are also other more simple programs, like antivirus programs? Are these classified as IDS systems? Yes, they are.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Unfortunately, many businesses aren’t familiar with all of the threats out there, and so they may not have as advanced of an IDS as they need. If you’re not familiar with the standards these days for your industry and your individual business needs, you want want to speak with a computer security expert. It’s not just businesses that need these types of systems either.</p>
                <br />

                <p>You may not have the most involved IDS if you are talking about your own residential network, but you sure do have to keep computer security in mind. Stay protected, and be sure that you do what you need to do in order to keep your computer network safe from outside threats, especially as technology progresses.</p>

              <h2>Networks and Cabling Benefits</h2>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>You enjoy cabling infrastructure and a business network that meets both the current and future demands of your business.</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>With the speed of technological change and the introduction of big data, the Internet of Things (IoT) etc, it is imperative that you have a business network that can handle the demands that you put on it.</p>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>Specified by qualified network and structured cabling designers</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>Know that you are getting a standards-based, compliant business network that will work for your business, both now and in the future. Knowing that you have a network that you can rely on, built by experienced cabling engineers using reliable components, will give you the confidence to focus on other aspects of your business.</p>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>Use of high-quality cabling and terminations throughout. All work fully tested and guaranteed</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>As mentioned, we only use high-quality cabling, hardware and terminations and we fully test and guarantee all of our networks for added peace of mind. Anything less will lead to high maintenance costs, disappointment and issues.</p>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>Reducing the risk of downtime to your business.</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>If you network is old, disorganized and largely unstructured, it will have a huge impact on your business workflow and both the happiness and productivity of your team. With a well-documented cabling plan, you can minimize the costs of downtime and any future issues can be found and fixed quickly.</p>

                <strong>Development Philosophy:</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>
                Development is a critical part of any project team we assemble. At
                <strong>infinytel</strong>, website development starts on day one of any project. Instead of bringing in our developers to code after all the key decisions have already been made, we ensure their expertise is part of key conversations from the beginning. This fully integrated team enables rapid decision making about direction and feasibility during planning and design phases.
              </p>
              <p>
                While we take a technology-agnostic approach – we want to recommend the right solution, not the solution we happen to know best – our teams are constantly training and deepening their expertise on the platforms we build on, many of which are
                <strong>infinytel</strong> partners, helping to ensure you always have access to cutting-edge expertise.

                <strong>Our Process</strong>
              </h5>

              <p>Our team has mastered multiple development approaches across various platforms and technologies. We’re more than happy to work in multiple ways, from agile methodologies to Waterfall preplanned phases. However, we do find that the majority of our clients prefer a hybrid approach, where we build using a Waterfall methodology, and then add new features and improvements in sprints (Agile).</p>
              <br />

              <p>
                No matter how we build, our process is iterative and includes multiple phases of revisions and cross-disciplinary reviews to ensure the ultimate solution is as good as it can possibly be. At
                <strong>infinytel</strong>, we take pride in the quality of our work. In order to ensure we’re meeting our own high standards – as well as yours – we have a team dedicated to reviewing, testing, and providing actionable feedback on everything that we produce. Focusing on functionality, performance, reliability, and security, the team runs through over 100 check points and works with the rest of the development team to squash bugs and enhance the website.

                  <p>
                    Focus on keywords and rankings, and you risk missing the SEO forest for the trees. Search tells a story: about your brand, you’re offering, and your reputation. Search engines put human users in control of how they research, learn, and buy – and there lies
                    the
                    <strong>opportunity</strong> and
                    the
                    <strong>challenge</strong>. Make yourself a relevant, informative source for searchers, and potential customers will quickly come to trust you (maybe even love you). Mismanage your
                    <strong>SEO</strong> and you become an irritant, or worse, invisible.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    SEO throws up new technical challenges all the time, from
                    <strong>algorithm changes</strong> to the impact of voice and AR/VR. And a good SEO agency naturally lives and breathes the technical stuff. Rankings matter, but SEO is not just about what ranks where. It’s
                    <strong>organic marketing</strong> – it’s about how content, user experience, and earned media combine to make your brand discoverable and attractive to your audience. That kind of holistic thinking demands not a technician, but a partner – which is exactly what BFM strives to be.

                    <strong>SEO</strong>. The work has changed (a lot), but SEO matters today for the reasons it always has. Search is where most customer journeys begin, it’s often where they end, and it’s usually a big part of the middle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Users worldwide make 3.5 billion searches each day, which is an astonishing
                    <strong>1.2 trillion searches per year</strong> – on Google alone. In this sea of search, how your brand stands out (and for what reasons) is largely determined by your SEO strategy – and how well it’s executed.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>And in a fast-paced world where irrelevance and interruption are tolerated less and less, showing up in search results is one of your best opportunities to reach customers the moment they’re open to hearing from you. What surfaces about your brand in search is often the first impression people get – and we all know how much first impressions count. If you’re authoritative, impressive, and easy to find, it could mean a new customer. Otherwise, it may be a missed opportunity.</p>
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <h2>Everything is Connected</h2>
                  <p>
                    At
                    <strong>infinytel</strong>, we take a big-picture approach to the SEO services we provide, for a couple reasons.
                    First, we believe that these days, there's no bright line between search and organic marketing when it comes to showcasing your brand or getting discovered. Second, we're working shoulder to shoulder with organic and paid marketers, content marketers, PR experts, developers, our team, and many other talented folks - we couldn't live in a silo even if we wanted.
                  </p>

                  <p>This holistic approach informs everything we do. We don't chase vanity metrics or industrial quantities of back links. What matters to us - just as it does to you - is brand lift and measurable impact on business results.</p>
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <h2>Our SEO Process</h2>
                  <p>If we're building your website, rest assured: technical optimization - title tags, redirects, structured data, and all the good stuff - is baked into the process. When you work with us on search marketing, we think through the technical, but we also think beyond it. Clients can and do bring us on for SEO audits, and we're always happy to help uncover fixes that can give you a bump in the rankings. But we'd link to think our true value comes from being an organic marketing partner.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    The SEO strategy we adopt may be part of a fully integrated
                    <strong>digital marketing strategy</strong> or a more channel-specific effort (depending on your needs) and will set the benchmarks that will help to measure success. We're equally attentive to the needs of global brands and the basics of local
                    <strong>SEO marketing</strong>. We'll assemble the talent you need from across disciplines to cover everything from your social media presence, reviews, and sites where you're linked to our talked about. We'll look for, or create, opportunities in content marketing, influencer, and digital PR.

                  <h2>MOBILE APPS DEVELOPMENT @ INFINYTEL</h2>
                  <p>Building an app for your brand isn’t about filling a missing channel. It’s about giving your customers a richer experience that puts their needs and motivations first.</p>
                  <p>Mobile phone users spend about 90 percent of their mobile using apps, Mobile apps account for more than half of all time spent by mobile phone users. We design best and user-friendly mobile apps with latest technology used.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>We have experienced development team</p>

                    </li>

                  <br />

                  <img src="http://localhost:3000/images/web-services/mobile.png" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Mobile technology has
                    <strong>taken</strong> over the world, and it’s not done growing. Tablets and phones have become some of the most critical channels for brands to engage with their customers. That doesn’t mean that an app is right for everyone. Mobile web design has come a long way, and websites offer versatility that apps can’t always match. Also, new mobile apps can be hard to discover, which means you need to be prepared to market an app robustly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But if your app has a
                    <strong>valuable</strong> job to do and the right support behind it, it can be an incredibly powerful tool for your brand. It might even achieve the Holy Grail – daily use and engagement by your target audience.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    As with any design work we do, at infinytel we take a
                    <strong>human-centric</strong> approach to app design that involves getting to know your users in depth. An app is a tool, and we spend a lot of time designing not just the look and feel, but the cues and interactions that inform and guide users.
                  </p>
                  <p>But that doesn’t mean we can’t also have fun – we also spend time thinking about the little touches that will surprise and delight people, creating moments that express your brand’s personality and keep your app fresh and interesting to use.</p>
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <h2>Built for Your Brand</h2>
                  <p>Before our talented designers start thinking about how to approach your app design, we begin a deep discovery process that includes stakeholder interviews, business data research, and prioritization of your brand’s objectives. It’s critical for us to understand what you intend to accomplish with your app, and what actions you want your users to take.</p>
                  <p>It’s also important for us to explore what your team likes, or doesn’t like, in the design of other apps, so we can gather direction and gain inspiration. We like to open a dialogue from the very beginning of the design process, to ensure we understand your needs and expectations and can give good advice about how best to meet them.</p>
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <h2>Created For Users</h2>
                  <p>
                    It’s been a decade since apps were introduced to the mobile market. Over that time, apps have changed dramatically. As user behavior, preferences, and expectations have evolved, so has the thinking and execution behind app design – being
                    <strong>human-centric</strong> and focused on users’ needs is now make or break for brands entering the space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During our app design process, we do
                    <strong>extensive</strong> audience research in order to understand how an app can solve your customers’ problems. Our goal? To create personas and example user journeys built on data, user interviews, user testing, and competitor analysis.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    This thinking is what connects the app’s design, messaging, and task flows into a
                    <strong>seamless</strong> experience, encouraging loyal customers to engage day after day.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <h2>Designed for Engagement</h2>
                  <p>
                    Apps work best when designers get out of the way of what users want to do, so naturally, we design with that
                    <strong>critical</strong> point in mind. Above all else, it’s important to design
                    <strong>interactions</strong> that make tasks easy for users to understand and execute, which also helps to streamline app development. But that doesn’t mean the
                    <strong>imagination</strong> has no place: an app should be enjoyable to spend time with, too.
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    That’s why our designers are always looking for places where accomplishing a task can add a little moment of joy to a user’s day – and create a
                    <strong>positive</strong> interaction that builds loyalty to your brand.
