                <h2>USING VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS</h2>

                <p>If you’re concerned about protecting your business from would-be intruders, you may wish to look into video surveillance systems. These systems can offer your home an added measure of protection.In addition to installing deadbolt locks and other security features, you may wish to install a surveillance system.There are many great systems available on the market today. From those that you can speak to from a remote area to those that you simply monitor, modern technology has made it easier than ever before to protect your home and business.</p>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Such surveillance systems are easy to install and can be
                  <strong>
                    <q>monitored</q>
                  </strong> either by you yourself or by a top
                  <strong>
                    <q>security company</q>
                  </strong> like
                  <strong>Infinytel.</strong> Either way, you’ve gained an extra measure of protection for your home.
                  If you’re the one that is monitoring your system you can have it ping you each time someone is at your door or breaches your motion detector.
                  Then, you can open an app and see who it is or if it’s an intruder. Once you know this information you can either communicate with them (if that is the type of system that you have) or you can call the police and have them check your premises.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Surveillance systems can reduce your homeowner’s insurance drastically. You’ll appreciate getting discounts on your insurance and being able to save money.
                  With modern technology what it is today, you can save a lot by installing video surveillance systems and it won’t be that expensive to do. Installation can be done in a few short hours or days depending on the type of installation.

                <p>
                  Access control systems restrict who may enter a facility in specified areas. Entry can be determined by person, day of the week, and/or time of day.
                  Building Security Systems (BSS) designs and installs quality, facility-specific work that secures property entry and complements existing infrastructure.
                  Upon request, BSS analysts can provide policy recommendations for lobby site visitor administration as well.

                  <strong>ADVANTAGES OF ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS OVER LOCK-AND-KEY SECURITY</strong>
                </h5>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Access command enables administrators to control when doors can be opened and by whom. With keys, access is all or nothing. If a worker has a key, he or she can enter any time of day or night</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>With card access, the system can disable a card when a card is lost or an individual no longer has entry privileges. If a key is lost or a staff member leaves, facility safety is compromised unless every lock is re-keyed</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Cards cannot be replicated. Keys can be duplicated, and there is no way to track who has a key</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Accessibility control systems develop an in-depth audit trail so administrators can understand precisely whose card opened up a doorway and when. Workers understand this, which discourages inappropriate behavior. Keys are anonymous.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>With accessibility command, one card opens every doorway the worker is enabled to open up. There’s no requirement for different keys for every lock (no more “large ring of keys”)</p>

                  <strong>ACCESS CONTROL SERVICES FOR ADDED SECURITY</strong>
                </h5>
                <p>Both employers and employees appreciate having a controlled door access system. This system is easy to use and involves either entering a code to get into your building or swiping a card. Even customers and clients will appreciate entering a building where there are access control systems installed. The peace of mind that access control services can bring is incredibly valuable. Additionally, today’s computerized systems are capable of protecting privacy.</p>
                <br />

                <p>There are more and more laws being issued all the time regarding businesses and their responsibility towards other people’s privacy. There are many components of these systems and each of them can be laid out and installed perfectly to work just the way your employees do. They will appreciate the extra layer of protection provided to them on a daily basis while on the job. In the event of a security breach, your system will alert authorities and get the situation under control.</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  While each building will have different needs, the main part of the system is the access control panel. This unit will get information from electrified door locks, keypads and card readers and permit entry only when it is authorized. You might also get a cloud-based component to make controlling and
                  <strong>monitoring</strong> the entire system as easy as it can be.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  You can also expect to have your
                  <strong>security service</strong> install card readers and provide your firm with employee cards for authorized entry. Systems can also be outfitted with sensors that allow exiting from the building when they detect a person standing beneath them. If you are ready to get an access control services in place you will want to work with a company that is a leader in this industry. They should have the proven experience to customize a whole system for you and install it.

                  <strong>INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS ARE IMPORTANT FOR NETWORK SECURITY</strong>
                </h5>

                <p>When it comes to system networks, there are all kinds of threats. That’s why many businesses and organizations take advantage of intrusion detection systems. They are very helpful in many different ways, but they can also be very complicated to understand. Do you have one of these systems in place? When you’re talking computers, you may be thinking about a firewall. However, an intrusion detection system isn’t what a firewall is about. Think about what the word intrusion means. It means that someone has broken in, right? A firewall means you have a wall up. So, you might need that firewall, too, but these intrusion detection systems are important for a variety of other reasons.</p>
                <br />

                <p>When you’re looking at these different systems, you do want to know the differences. Some are much more involved than others, and there are also different types. Now, firewalls were mentioned, and we said they were different from these systems we’re talking about. However, there are also other more simple programs, like antivirus programs? Are these classified as IDS systems? Yes, they are.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Unfortunately, many businesses aren’t familiar with all of the threats out there, and so they may not have as advanced of an IDS as they need. If you’re not familiar with the standards these days for your industry and your individual business needs, you want want to speak with a computer security expert. It’s not just businesses that need these types of systems either.</p>
                <br />

                <p>You may not have the most involved IDS if you are talking about your own residential network, but you sure do have to keep computer security in mind. Stay protected, and be sure that you do what you need to do in order to keep your computer network safe from outside threats, especially as technology progresses.</p>

              <h2>Networks and Cabling Benefits</h2>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>You enjoy cabling infrastructure and a business network that meets both the current and future demands of your business.</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>With the speed of technological change and the introduction of big data, the Internet of Things (IoT) etc, it is imperative that you have a business network that can handle the demands that you put on it.</p>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>Specified by qualified network and structured cabling designers</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>Know that you are getting a standards-based, compliant business network that will work for your business, both now and in the future. Knowing that you have a network that you can rely on, built by experienced cabling engineers using reliable components, will give you the confidence to focus on other aspects of your business.</p>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>Use of high-quality cabling and terminations throughout. All work fully tested and guaranteed</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>As mentioned, we only use high-quality cabling, hardware and terminations and we fully test and guarantee all of our networks for added peace of mind. Anything less will lead to high maintenance costs, disappointment and issues.</p>
              <br />

              <h5>
                <strong>Reducing the risk of downtime to your business.</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>If you network is old, disorganized and largely unstructured, it will have a huge impact on your business workflow and both the happiness and productivity of your team. With a well-documented cabling plan, you can minimize the costs of downtime and any future issues can be found and fixed quickly.</p>
